# Features to be added in Phase 2
- [] Create a sticky "Search Now!" button that follows the user and can be seen wherever the user is on the CSteps Coach page (Chase)

    - [] One for the homepage menu bar, directly below the search bar
    - [] One for all other pages' menu bars. The CSteps Coach button should appear after the user clicks on the search button and be located to the right of the search's input box.
    - [] "On the Steps page (https://climatesteps.org/climate-steps/), in the blue section at the bottom of the page (image coming)"
        * Not sure where this section is at; will need Annette to point out
    * Chase can create the html/css for the buttons while Trent implements them into the site
- [] Implementing the functionality of the CSteps Coach search tool to allow for EH posts to be both searched and displayed to the user (Chase/Trent)
    - [] Adding appropriate tags to EH posts to enable EH posts to be searched/filtered based off of their tags (Chase)
