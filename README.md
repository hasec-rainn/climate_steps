# Features to be added in Phase 2
- [X] Create a sticky "Search Now!" button that follows the user and can be seen wherever the user is on the CSteps Coach page (Chase)
- [X] Create tool entrances: buttons that will take the user to the CSteps Coach tool page where the user can use the search tool (Chase/Trent)
    - [X] One for the homepage menu bar, directly below the search bar
    - [X] One for all other pages' menu bars. The CSteps Coach button should appear after the user clicks on the search button and be located to the right of the search's input box.
    - [ ] "On the Steps page (https://climatesteps.org/climate-steps/), in the blue section at the bottom of the page (image coming)"
        * Not sure where this section is at; will need Annette to point out
    * Chase can create the html/css for the buttons while Trent implements them into the site
- [ ] Implementing the functionality of the CSteps Coach search tool to allow for EH posts to be both searched and displayed to the user (Chase/Trent)
    - [ ] Adding appropriate tags to EH posts to enable EH posts to be searched/filtered based off of their tags (Chase)
    - [ ] Searching/filtering EH posts based on their tags and based on certain keywords contained within the posts (Trent)
        * Search should be able to handle filtering/searching through 2000 posts
        * Users' search input and data should not be stored long-term; user data should only be temporarily stored to perform the search and display the results.
        * The search results page of the CSteps Coach tool should be formatted like the search results of the regular search tool on the Climate Steps website
            * If time allows, a logo of EH and a small image thumbnail should be added alongside each post on the result page

# Features and Improvements to be added for Phase 3
- [X] Align the header text for the search so that "Find the right steps for YOU" isn't touching the bottom
- [X] Align the sticky search button so that it aligns with the very top of the tool when the user is at the top of the coach page
- [X] Fix the spacing around the "Additional Questions" buttons to ensure that all of them have uniform spacing
- [X] Remove the explaination text below individual subjects. Then, place the explaination "Click the checkbox if you want a subject included in the search" at the start of each section, as a way to cut down on unnecessary text.
- [X] Add in information text to inform user that information entered on the page will not be stored beyond using it to perform the search 
- [X] Move info button to be right next to the subsection (subject) text. Additionally, have the info button grey out when the subject is disabled.
- [X] Swap shield icon with hurtle icon
- [X] Change blue color to be lighter
- [X] Add a bit more space above titles of blue sections
