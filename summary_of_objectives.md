## Project 1
* Create an iFrame (in-line display in html) on the CSteps website that pulls in information from SciStarter and other organizations and displays it for users to view. The information from these organizations will be fetched from [user-made] queries.

## Project 2
* Find, through personal research and discussion with experts, the best plugin that allows WordPress to access AirTable datasets
	* Needed to allow Climate Steps website to pull in data from Air Table (WP=middle man)
		* [Is there a way to eliminate the middle man?]
		* Maybe, but would like to still use it
* On the CS Steps website, take in information from Air Table and display it in a timed frame box on the homepage.
	* The information displayed will be a subset of data from "Climate Step Examples"; more specifically, this subset will be all the "Easy Climate Steps" data points.
	* A plugin will be needed to draw in the data from Air Table, and the data will be filtered (by grabbing either easy, medium, or hard climate actions)
	* the container ("timed frame") will display information in a particular fashion; new data will appear in the frame every Sunday

## Project 3
* Pull data, known as "actions", from Earth Hero Air Table into CSteps website.
	* Actions must be displayed in one of the following format:
		* The title is shown under an icon or under Earth Heroâ€™s picture for that action and is selectable.
