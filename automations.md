# Potential Areas to add automations:
* Uniform design for posts:
	* Touched on by Annette and Ben and Kat
	* Deciding the formatting of images and text takes up time; potentially there could be post formats for the various posts that need to be published onto Climate Steps
* Creating bots to notify various Social Media Platforms when a new climate step is published
	* Touched on by Annette
	* Instead of having to manually post to Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Slack, etc - a bot on each of these platforms could do this automatically
* Creating a program that automatically enters references & citations as records into Airtable
	* Touched on by Ben
	* No more manually having to go in and add things
	* User supplies hyperlink to the reference, and the program adds it into Airtable automatically
* ~~Invoice creation of Climate Steps employees~~
* Fixing broken links (in the reference section of the database)

# Bot Ideas
* Report of which groups messages were sent to
* Subspace
